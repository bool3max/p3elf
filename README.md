# **p3elf**

A tiny python3 module for parsing ELF file metadata that I'm writing to familiarize myself with python binary IO as well as to gain more python experience.

Currently has the ability to read the Header as well as the Program Header.

## TODO
    * add ability to parse various section headers
    * cli tool
    * publish on pip for fun (familiarize myself with setuptools etc.)
    * library docs?
